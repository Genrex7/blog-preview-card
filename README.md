### What I learned

I learned the importance of using semantic HTML elements like `<main>` to organize content logically. This not only improve accessibility and SEO but also make the code more readable and maintainable. The `<head>` section includes important metadata, a favicon, and links to external stylesheets â€” all crucial for a complete web document.

I imported the Figtree font from Google Fonts to establish a cohesive and modern typeface across the project. I also learned to use `rem` units for font sizes, which makes the text more responsive and scalable across devices.

Importing fonts from Google Fonts was easy and made my text look unique and cool.

```html
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com" />
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin />
<link
	href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Figtree:ital,wght@0,300..900;1,300..900&display=swap"
	rel="stylesheet"
/>
```

To make the card feel interactive, I added hover effects using:

```css
transform: translateY(-8px);
box-shadow: 16px 16px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.9);
transition: all 0.3s ease;
```

In queries.css, I applied media queries to make the design responsive. I learned how to resize text and padding for smaller screens.

```css
@media (max-width: 375px) {
}
```

Following a desktop-first approach helped me ensure the UI is accessible and usable on almost all device sizes, from phones to desktops.
