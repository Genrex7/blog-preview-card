### What I learned

I learned that organizing HTML elements well using &lt;div&gt;, &lt;img&gt;, and &lt;p&gt; tags makes the code clearer.

With CSS, I could style everything nicely. Playing around with properties like colors, sizes, and fonts helped me make the design look good. Flexbox was super handy for positioning things neatly inside the card.

Using gradient backgrounds with linear-gradient() made the design more interesting and appealing.

```css
background-image: linear-gradient(225deg, #8ec5fc 0%, #e0c3fc 100%);
```

Importing fonts from Google Fonts was easy and made my text look unique and cool.

```html
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com" />
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin />
<link
	href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Outfit&family=Poppins:wght@400;500;700&display=swap"
	rel="stylesheet"
/>
```

Making sure the component looks good on different devices was important. Setting the width and height to 100vw and 100vh made it adapt well to different screen sizes. Overall, this project helped me learn a bunch of modern web design tricks that made my QR code component both stylish and functional.
